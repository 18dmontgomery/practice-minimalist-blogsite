# Minimalist Blogsite
This is a website that I created to practice my html and css skills. For this website, I wanted to improve on my css skills. Specifically, making sure the website was responsive to different viewports. I used a mobile first approach when creating my website, and adjusted the content the wider the viewport becomes.
